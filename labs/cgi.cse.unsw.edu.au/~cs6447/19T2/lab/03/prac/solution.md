## Intended Prac solution: ##

Students are first to look at either the source code to get the username, or better, use a format string
exploit to leak it off the stack.

Once the correct username is entered, you can then leak the password off the stack as well.

Finally, once logged in you you can exploit the format string vuln to change a target variable and get 
leet hacker status
